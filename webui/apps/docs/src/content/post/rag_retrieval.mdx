This is Part 3 of a 3 part series on Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

For general information on RAG, see [Part 1: Define RAG and its components.](/rag)

For information on configuring RAG storage in Eidolon, see [Part 2: How is RAG storage configured in Eidolon.](/rag_storage).

In the last post, we discussed how to configure RAG storage in Eidolon. In this post, we will discuss how to configure retrieval in Eidolon. Retrieval is the process of selecting a set of document fragments from a vector
database that are relevant to the current context. The retrieved fragments are then used to generate a response. Retrieval is a key component of the
RAG model, and is responsible for providing the model with the information it needs to generate coherent and informative responses.
